# angularjsfire-with-reg-confirmation â€” the seed for AngularFire apps with account registration confirmation

It is AngularJS seed with Firebase backend and a feature for account registration confirmation via email. This feature can be used as an alternative for account activation. It is a clone of [AngularFire Seed](https://github.com/firebase/angularFire-seed) with additional feature above and also login feature vial social login ie login with Facebook, Twitter, and Google.

The account registration differs significantly from the original seed. We can register for an account just by supplying an email and then we'll get a confirmation email about our temporary random password. The password is recommended to be changed to a memorable one and at the same time it must also be strong and secure.

This project is an application skeleton for a typical [AngularFire](http://angularfire.com/) web app.
This library allows you to quickly bootstrap real-time apps using [Firebase](http://www.firebase.com) and [AngularJS](http://www.angularjs.org).

The seed contains AngularJS libraries, test libraries and a bunch of scripts all preconfigured for
instant web development gratification. Just clone the repo (or download the zip/tarball), start up
our (or yours) webserver and you are ready to develop and test your application.

The seed app doesn't do much, just shows how to wire controllers and views together and persist them
in Firebase. You can check it out by opening app/index.html in your browser (it might not work
with `file://` scheme in certain browsers, see note below).

_Note: While angular, angularFire, and Firebase can be used client-side-only, and it's possible to create
apps that don't require a backend server at all, we recommend hosting the project files using a local
webserver during development to avoid issues with security restrictions (sandbox) in browsers. The
sandbox implementation varies between browsers, but quite often prevents things like cookies, xhr,
etc to function properly when an html page is opened via `file://` scheme instead of `http://`._


## How to use angularFire-seed

 1. Clone the angularFire-seed repository
 1. Open app/js/config.js and add your Firebase URL
 1. Go to your Firebase URL and enable email/password authentication under the Auth tab
 1. Start hacking...

### Serving pages during development

You can pick one of these options:

* serve this repository with your webserver
* install node.js and run `node scripts/web-server.js`

Then navigate your browser to `http://localhost:<port>/app/index.html` to see the app running in
your browser.


### Running the app in production

Make sure you set up security rules for your Firebase! An example for this
seed can be found in `config/security-rules.json`

Go to your Forge (open your Firebase URL in the browser) and add your sites domain name under
Auth -> Authorized Request Origins. This allows simple login to work from your web site as well as localhost.

The rest really depends on how complex is your app and the overall infrastructure of your system, but
the general rule is that all you need in production are all the files under the `app/` directory.
Everything else can be omitted.

Angular apps are really just a bunch of static html, css and js files that just need to be hosted
somewhere, where they can be accessed by browsers.

If your Angular app is talking to the backend server via xhr or other means, you need to figure
out what is the best way to host the static files to comply with the same origin policy if
applicable. Usually this is done by hosting the files by the backend server or through
reverse-proxying the backend server(s) and a webserver(s).


### Running unit tests

We recommend using [jasmine](http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine/) and
[Karma](http://karma-runner.github.io) for your unit tests/specs, but you are free
to use whatever works for you.

Requires [node.js](http://nodejs.org/), Karma (`sudo npm install -g karma`) and a local
or remote browser.

* start `scripts/test.sh` (on windows: `scripts\test.bat`)
  * a browser will start and connect to the Karma server (Chrome is default browser, others can be captured by loading the same url as the one in Chrome or by changing the `config/karma.conf.js` file)
* to run or re-run tests just change any of your source or test javascript files


### End to end testing

Angular ships with a baked-in end-to-end test runner that understands angular, your app and allows
you to write your tests with jasmine-like BDD syntax.

Requires a webserver, node.js + `./scripts/web-server.js` or your backend server that hosts the angular static files.

Check out the
[end-to-end runner's documentation](http://docs.angularjs.org/guide/dev_guide.e2e-testing) for more
info.

* create your end-to-end tests in `test/e2e/scenarios.js`
* serve your project directory with your http/backend server or node.js + `scripts/web-server.js`
* to run do one of:
  * open `http://localhost:port/test/e2e/runner.html` in your browser
  * run the tests from console with [Karma](http://karma-runner.github.io) via
    `scripts/e2e-test.sh` or `script/e2e-test.bat`

### Receiving updates from upstream

When we upgrade angular-seed's repo with newer angular or testing library code, you can just
fetch the changes and merge them into your project with git.
